# The following is a script to set up local apps support on LTSP through LDM
#
# The presumption is that the environment is set up such that NSS will look
# at extrafiles, ie. additional local files for passwd and group beyond
# those found in /etc.
#
# This will enable us to easily bypass the need for setting up local user
# authentication, and instead leverage the authentication already set up on
# the server.

# Start ltsp-localappsd now so we can run the localapp with the right locale
